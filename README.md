# World Weather Analysis

### The purpose of this analysis is to use API calls to gather the current weather for a random set of latitudes and longitudes. Once that analysis is generated, Google maps will be utilized to map driving directions of a possible vacation by choosing 4 different cities within the USA.

## Results

#### After generating the random latitudes and longitudes, the results were entered into a dataframe so they could be analyzed further. The below dataframe shows the fields that were captured in an attempt to add information via the Google API.
